Assignment 0 for CS 290


1. The Final Fantasy XIV Lodestone, https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/, the information and navigation is great. Your character in-game is synced to the website too, and is easy to compare to other characters with a quick search. 
2. Youtube, https://youtube.com, bombards you instantly with thumbnails of multiple videos, however, the algorithm always seems to find an assortment of videos that do interest me. 
3. Roll20, https://roll20.net, this is the website where most of my D&D games are played. It is a pretty decent digital tabletop, where the Dungeon Master is able to import maps on a grid that they made personally, or ones they made on the site right there. What I dislike is that the virtual dice roller always seems to give the DM rolls that are not in the party's favor!!! (Or it seems that way)
4. Twitter
